=======

Simple iOS project fetching data from iTunes API, showing a list of songs and some details.
Implements Quick and Nimble for unit tests, Nimble-Snapshots for UI and some other stuff.
This project does **NOT** use storyboard... because it sucks for large teams.

¿How to run the project?
-----------
Just run `pod install` and all the dependencies should be installed.

¿Any questions?
