=======

Simple iOS project fetching data from iTunes API, showing a list of songs and some details.
Implements Quick and Nimble for unit tests, Nimble-Snapshots for UI and some other stuff.
This project does **NOT** use storyboard... because it sucks for large teams.

**Xcode version developed on:** 11.6  
**Cocoapods version:** 1.9.3

¿How to run the project?
-----------
Just run `pod install` and all the dependencies should be installed.

Unit testing
-----------
The unit tests MUST be run using an **iPhone SE (first gen) using iOS 13.6 simulator** , otherwise It will fail in taking the snapshots.

¿Any questions?
-----------
